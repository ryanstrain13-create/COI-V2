The Zone Master Sample: [Darryn Peterson is a very rock solid guard prospect, with both a high floor and a high ceiling as a creator. Last season, for Prolific Prep, he was either ‘Excellent' or ‘Very Good’ in every playtype except handoffs. What sticks out most about his profile is his efficiency at the rim — he made roughly 70% of his shots at the rim, with 25% being dunks. On dribble jumpers, among players with at least 100 of them, he was ranked #3 in efficiency with a PPP of 1.0.

He also averaged four stocks per game, and the film backs that he’s a very measured defensive guard, so I think we can reliably say, at the college level, he’s fit to be a top-tier initiator and guard defender.

He hasn’t played a ton yet, but in the few minutes he has, he’s looked unbelievable.


I guess one of the bigger questions for Peterson is what type of on-ball creator he’ll be. I can see a variety of outcomes — some look Shai-esque, and others in which he looks like more of a wing in terms of functionality. Neither of these would be bad, and this versatility is probably good, but I think the ultimate outcome is becoming a jumbo on-ball creator, with the on-ball passing chops to supplement.

Neil Paine Sample: [How the NBA Elo forecast model works
This year’s NBA forecast introduces a new twist on traditional Elo — one that better reflects the different dynamics of the regular season and the playoffs.

Like before, the model maintains ratings for every team based on how they’ve performed and who they’ve played, adjusting for the quality of the opposition and home-court advantage. These ratings are converted into win probabilities for each game, and the rest of the season is simulated thousands of times to project standings and championship odds.

But instead of a rating based on rolling efficiency ratings, I now track two versions of Elo for every team — one tuned for the regular season and another for the playoffs.

The regular-season Elo evolves primarily based on regular-season games. It’s designed to reflect teams’ day-to-day form — the things that fluctuate across an 82-game grind, with all the scheduling, injuries and random swings that come with it. These ratings react a bit more quickly to new information, giving extra weight to recent games while still accounting for margin of victory and opponent strength.

The playoff Elo, meanwhile, updates more heavily from postseason games and moves more slowly during the regular season. This track captures a longer-term view of team quality — the kind that tends to matter in May and June, when rotations tighten and effort levels spike. It places more emphasis on playoff performance and continuity, rewarding teams that have proven themselves under postseason conditions.

The two systems also interact. Regular-season results slightly influence playoff ratings (and vice versa), so that each track informs the other without hurting their different purposes. Over time, this helps the model distinguish between teams that are built to thrive in the regular season versus those that are better suited for playoff basketball.

Each offseason, ratings are partially regressed toward the league average before the new season begins — reflecting that rosters change and teams rarely pick up exactly where they left off. I also blend in converted Elos via preseason odds (over/unders for regular-season Elo; title odds for the playoffs) Once the season starts, the dual Elo system quickly recalibrates based on new results.

As in past versions, the game-by-game win probabilities are fed into a Monte Carlo simulation that plays out the rest of the schedule thousands of times to estimate playoff odds, Finals probabilities and title chances for each team.

Limitations of the model
No model can perfectly capture how a team’s true strength evolves over a long season. This system focuses only on the scoreboard — who won, by how much, and where the game was played — and doesn’t yet account for lineup changes, trades or injuries in real time.

To help bridge that gap, my default Composite Mode blends the dual-track Elo projections with implied betting-market probabilities from FanDuel, which tend to reflect real-world adjustments for player availability and other contextual factors.

If you prefer to see how the numbers behave in isolation, the Stats-Only Mode removes those betting inputs, leaving a purely results-based forecast grounded in the dual-track Elo system.

Jackie Mac Sample: [The trade for Isaiah Thomas provided Boston with a scorer who could utilize the high screen and break down defenses with his range and penetration capabilities. Crowder and Jerebko benefitted immediately from the open looks Thomas provided them when he drew a crowd in the paint and kicked it back out.

Both Avery Bradley and Smart thrive off the ball, while Thomas needs and wants the ball to be in his hands, so it works -- for now, anyway. He is an exciting player who is the top Celtic in player efficiency rating (40th overall).

Yet Thomas should not be tabbed as a savior. He's more like a double shot of espresso: He provides a badly needed jolt that pays instant dividends, but eventually the buzz wears off and you need additional sustenance.

Before Wednesday, Thomas was ranked 18th overall among point guards in real plus minus. Only five players had higher offensive plus minus (plus-3.95) totals than him: Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Damon Lillard and Kyrie Irving.

The flip side was that among top-40 point guards (Rondo, incidentally, was ranked 46th), none had a defensive real plus minus as low as Thomas (minus-2.64).

His defensive deficiencies stem from his diminutive frame and the ability of opponents to shoot over him. Thomas is also a liability as a rebounder.]

Logan Adams Sample: [Just like in the NBA, it’s not often players come into the NCAA and are immediately known for what they bring on the defensive end. Iowa State freshman Killyan Toure is one of those rarities.

Toure wasn’t a household name coming out of Brewster Academy. He was a four-star and the 180th-ranked player in 247Sports’ composite rankings, even falling from his peak as the 157th-ranked player back in April to the close of the cycle in August.

At 6 feet, 3 inches, Toure was an underwhelming offensive piece, who didn’t create much on the ball and didn’t excel as a primary playmaker. He was a great athlete with a head of steam, long arms and an intense motor, but the skill lacked refinement, and his ranking reflected that.

The expectation was that Iowa State would bring him along slowly, allow him to adjust and develop while the offense caught up to the defense for a T.J. Otzelberger team that wanted to contend. He made noise throughout the offseason, but when it was announced he’d made the Cyclones’ opening night starting five — playing 28 minutes in an 88-50 win — it still came as a surprise.

As it’s turned out, Toure’s defense has been more than enough to make up for a less-than-complete offensive game, which has still allowed him to get to 11.5 points per game on mostly cuts, straight-line drives and transition takes, while making a healthy 39 percent of his limited 3-point attempts.

To be a true NBA prospect, Toure will have to develop on the offensive end, but early on, he’s made a name for himself as a boogeyman for any caliber of primary ball-handler.]
