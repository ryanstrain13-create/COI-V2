The Zone Master Sample: [Darryn Peterson is a very rock solid guard prospect, with both a high floor and a high ceiling as a creator. Last season, for Prolific Prep, he was either ‘Excellent' or ‘Very Good’ in every playtype except handoffs. What sticks out most about his profile is his efficiency at the rim — he made roughly 70% of his shots at the rim, with 25% being dunks. On dribble jumpers, among players with at least 100 of them, he was ranked #3 in efficiency with a PPP of 1.0.

He also averaged four stocks per game, and the film backs that he’s a very measured defensive guard, so I think we can reliably say, at the college level, he’s fit to be a top-tier initiator and guard defender.

He hasn’t played a ton yet, but in the few minutes he has, he’s looked unbelievable.


I guess one of the bigger questions for Peterson is what type of on-ball creator he’ll be. I can see a variety of outcomes — some look Shai-esque, and others in which he looks like more of a wing in terms of functionality. Neither of these would be bad, and this versatility is probably good, but I think the ultimate outcome is becoming a jumbo on-ball creator, with the on-ball passing chops to supplement.
